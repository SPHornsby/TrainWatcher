# TrainWatcher
TrainWatcher is a dynamic application that displays the OC Metro train schedule and deviance from that schedule.

I am planning to build it in two parts. First, an Express API connected to a PostgreSQL database. Then a modern SPA using either React or Angular.

I would like to use smart analysis of the Metro's twitter accounts to update the actual arrival times.

Eventually I would like to allow users to report train arrivals and departures and utilize those reports to keep track of the trains.
